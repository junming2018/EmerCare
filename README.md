Most people know the importance of first aid and healthcare knowledge to them, but most of them do not take action to learn it. In recent years, people started looking into this issue and are more concerned about their health since they cannot go to the clinic or hospital frequently because of the Covid-19 pandemic. This has led to those suffering from diseases such as Diabetes or High Blood Pressure cannot constantly monitor their blood glucose level or blood pressure level to know their health condition from time to time. Doctors may also need their health data records to give the prescription to them. However, there are some first aid and healthcare mobile applications in the market that only focus on one functionality such as first aid learning, blood glucose lever tracker or nearby hospital finder, but there is no mobile application that includes all these functionalities. Some of these applications may need the users to subscribe to use their services and some of them are not user-friendly and need to be tech-savvy to use them. The objective of First Aid and Healthcare Mobile Application: EmerCare is to promote first aid and healthcare knowledge and to provide a free and user-friendly health tracker for users. Besides, this project aims to develop an application that users just have to download one application and they can have functions that can be used during emergencies as well as daily healthcare. Hence, our users can use this application to record their health data and track their data with a user-friendly dashboard for external use for free. Besides, our users from all around the world can contact or navigate to their nearby hospital, police station and more with a click without having a long time of searching when they are having an emergency issue. Moreover, our users can also have full access to the resources of first aid, healthcare and more in the form of text, video and more for free. Thus, EmerCare application Usability Test was conducted on 30 respondents through a questionnaire with 35 questions and the results of the test showed that EmerCare application users were satisfied with the entire application developed. EmerCare application is in line with National Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) Policy in Malaysia.
